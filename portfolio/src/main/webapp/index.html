      <p>A first-generation international undergraduate student from Cyprus
           and Romania at Smith College with a double major in Government and 
           Computer Science. With extensive transferable and interpersonal 
           skills combined with enthusiasm for technology, international 
           development, politics, and finance, I use my innate desire to 
           create community to help institutions grow, advance and develop 
           while working with data and software.</p>
